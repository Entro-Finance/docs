# Decentralized Governance

## Governance Model

Entro Finance implements a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure where ENTRO token holders participate in protocol governance.

## Proposal Process

2. **Discussion Period**: 7-day community discussion phase
3. **Voting Period**: 5-day voting window
4. **Implementation**: Approved proposals are executed

## Voting Power

Voting power is determined by:
- ENTRO token holdings
- Staking duration multiplier
- Participation bonus for consistent voters
