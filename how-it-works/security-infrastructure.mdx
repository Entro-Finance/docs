# Security Infrastructure

Entro Finance implements bank-grade security measures combined with blockchain immutability to protect user assets and sensitive information.

## Architecture Overview

### Defense in Depth Strategy

Our security model consists of multiple independent layers, each designed to protect against specific threat vectors. Even if one layer is compromised, others remain intact to protect user assets.

## Smart Contract Security

### Formal Verification

Critical contract functions are formally verified using mathematical proofs to ensure correctness:

- **Invariant Checking**: Balance consistency across operations
- **Overflow Protection**: Safe math operations throughout
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions verified
- **State Transitions**: Valid state changes only

### Upgrade Mechanisms

Smart contracts use time-locked proxy patterns for safe upgrades:

- **48-hour timelock**: All upgrades subject to delay
- **Multi-sig requirement**: 3 of 5 signatures needed
- **Emergency pause**: Instant freeze capability for security events

## Infrastructure Security

### Hardware Security Modules

Sensitive cryptographic operations are performed in HSMs:

- **Card Number Generation**: FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified HSMs
- **Key Management**: Hierarchical deterministic key derivation
- **PIN Storage**: Encrypted and stored separately from card data

### Data Encryption

All sensitive data is encrypted at multiple levels:

**At Rest**:
- AES-256-GCM encryption for database storage
- Encrypted backups with separate key management
- Hardware-encrypted storage drives

**In Transit**:
- TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- Certificate pinning for mobile applications
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive operations

## Access Control

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Users must verify their identity through multiple factors:

1. **Something you know**: Password or PIN
2. **Something you have**: Device or hardware key
3. **Something you are**: Biometric verification

### Biometric Security

Advanced biometric options for account protection:

- **Face ID/Touch ID**: Mobile app authentication
- **WebAuthn**: Hardware key support for web access
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Typing patterns and usage analysis

## Compliance Framework

### Regulatory Compliance

Adhering to global financial regulations:

- **PCI DSS Level 1**: Card data security standards
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security and availability controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy

### AML/KYC Procedures

Comprehensive anti-money laundering controls:

- **Identity Verification**: Document and biometric checks
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Suspicious activity detection
- **Sanctions Screening**: Real-time OFAC and global lists
- **Risk Scoring**: Dynamic risk assessment per user
