# Security Infrastructure

Entro Finance implements bank-grade security measures combined with blockchain immutability to protect user assets and sensitive information.

## Architecture Overview

### Defense in Depth Strategy

Our security model consists of multiple independent layers, each designed to protect against specific threat vectors. Even if one layer is compromised, others remain intact to protect user assets.

## Smart Contract Security

### Audit History

All smart contracts undergo rigorous third-party audits before deployment:

| Auditor | Audit Date | Findings | Status |
|---------|------------|----------|--------|
| CertiK | March 2024 | 2 Low, 0 Critical | Resolved |
| Halborn | April 2024 | 1 Medium, 3 Low | Resolved |
| Quantstamp | May 2024 | 0 Issues | Passed |

### Formal Verification

Critical contract functions are formally verified using mathematical proofs to ensure correctness:

- **Invariant Checking**: Balance consistency across operations
- **Overflow Protection**: Safe math operations throughout
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions verified
- **State Transitions**: Valid state changes only

### Upgrade Mechanisms

Smart contracts use time-locked proxy patterns for safe upgrades:

- **48-hour timelock**: All upgrades subject to delay
- **Multi-sig requirement**: 3 of 5 signatures needed
- **Emergency pause**: Instant freeze capability for security events

## Infrastructure Security

### Hardware Security Modules

Sensitive cryptographic operations are performed in HSMs:

- **Card Number Generation**: FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certified HSMs
- **Key Management**: Hierarchical deterministic key derivation
- **PIN Storage**: Encrypted and stored separately from card data

### Data Encryption

All sensitive data is encrypted at multiple levels:

**At Rest**:
- AES-256-GCM encryption for database storage
- Encrypted backups with separate key management
- Hardware-encrypted storage drives

**In Transit**:
- TLS 1.3 for all API communications
- Certificate pinning for mobile applications
- End-to-end encryption for sensitive operations

## Access Control

### Multi-Factor Authentication

Users must verify their identity through multiple factors:

1. **Something you know**: Password or PIN
2. **Something you have**: Device or hardware key
3. **Something you are**: Biometric verification

### Biometric Security

Advanced biometric options for account protection:

- **Face ID/Touch ID**: Mobile app authentication
- **WebAuthn**: Hardware key support for web access
- **Behavioral Analytics**: Typing patterns and usage analysis

## Fraud Detection System

### Real-Time Monitoring

Every transaction passes through our fraud detection engine:

```python
class FraudDetectionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.ml_model = self.load_trained_model()
        self.rule_engine = RuleBasedDetector()
        self.anomaly_detector = AnomalyDetector()
    
    def analyze_transaction(self, tx):
        # Machine learning risk score
        ml_risk = self.ml_model.predict(tx.features)
        
        # Rule-based checks
        rule_violations = self.rule_engine.check(tx)
        
        # Anomaly detection
        anomaly_score = self.anomaly_detector.score(tx)
        
        # Combined risk assessment
        final_risk = self.combine_scores(
            ml_risk, 
            rule_violations, 
            anomaly_score
        )
        
        if final_risk > 0.8:
            return {'action': 'BLOCK', 'reason': 'High risk'}
        elif final_risk > 0.5:
            return {'action': 'CHALLENGE', 'reason': '3DS required'}
        else:
            return {'action': 'APPROVE'}
```

### Pattern Recognition

Our system identifies and blocks suspicious patterns:

- **Velocity Checking**: Unusual transaction frequency
- **Geographic Impossibility**: Transactions from impossible locations
- **Amount Anomalies**: Transactions outside normal spending patterns
- **Merchant Risk**: Known fraudulent merchant detection

## Network Security

### DDoS Protection

Multi-tier protection against distributed attacks:

- **CloudFlare Enterprise**: Global edge network protection
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-IP and per-account limits
- **Geographic Filtering**: Block traffic from high-risk regions
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Identify and block bot traffic

### API Security

Comprehensive API protection measures:

- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure authentication flow
- **API Keys**: Rotatable keys with granular permissions
- **Request Signing**: HMAC-SHA256 request signatures
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage

## Incident Response

### Security Operations Center

24/7 monitoring and response team:

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous system surveillance
- **Automated Alerts**: Instant notification of anomalies
- **Rapid Response**: 15-minute response time SLA
- **Post-Incident Analysis**: Detailed forensics and improvements

### Disaster Recovery

Comprehensive backup and recovery procedures:

- **Geographic Redundancy**: Data replicated across 3+ regions
- **Hot Standby**: Instant failover capability
- **Regular Drills**: Monthly disaster recovery testing
- **RPO/RTO Targets**: 1-hour RPO, 4-hour RTO

## Compliance Framework

### Regulatory Compliance

Adhering to global financial regulations:

- **PCI DSS Level 1**: Card data security standards
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Security and availability controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management
- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy

### AML/KYC Procedures

Comprehensive anti-money laundering controls:

- **Identity Verification**: Document and biometric checks
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Suspicious activity detection
- **Sanctions Screening**: Real-time OFAC and global lists
- **Risk Scoring**: Dynamic risk assessment per user

## User Protection Features

### Transaction Controls

Users have granular control over card security:

- **Instant Freeze**: Disable card immediately via app
- **Spending Limits**: Set daily, weekly, monthly limits
- **Merchant Restrictions**: Block specific categories
- **Geographic Controls**: Limit usage to specific regions
