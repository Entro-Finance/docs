# Payment Processing Infrastructure

Entro Finance leverages a sophisticated payment processing system that enables instant conversion and settlement of cryptocurrency transactions through traditional payment networks.

## Transaction Lifecycle

### Authorization Phase

The authorization process begins when a cardholder initiates a payment. Our system processes the request through multiple validation layers:

1. **Merchant Request**: Payment terminal sends authorization request
2. **Network Routing**: Request routes through Visa/Mastercard networks
3. **Issuer Processing**: Entro validates card status and balance
4. **Blockchain Verification**: Smart contract confirms available funds
5. **Response Generation**: Approval or decline sent back to merchant

This entire process completes in under 400 milliseconds, matching traditional card processing speeds.

## Settlement Mechanisms

### Merchant Settlement

Merchants receive payments through standard banking rails:

**Settlement Options**:
- **T+0 Instant**: Available for verified merchants
- **T+1 Standard**: Next business day settlement
- **Weekly Batch**: Accumulated weekly payments

### Network Fee Distribution

Transaction fees are automatically distributed:

| Recipient | Percentage | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Liquidity Providers | 0.20% | Maintaining conversion pools |
| Network Operations | 0.15% | Infrastructure costs |
| ENTRO Buyback | 0.10% | Token value support |
| Treasury | 0.05% | Protocol development |

## Fraud Prevention

### Machine Learning Detection

Our ML models analyze transactions in real-time:

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies unusual spending patterns
