# Data Transformation

## Protocol Data Pipeline

### Transaction Data Processing

Entro Finance implements sophisticated data transformation pipelines for processing on-chain transaction data. The system aggregates, normalizes, and enriches blockchain events for real-time analysis.

### Data Normalization Framework

**Input Processing**  
Raw transaction data from Solana blockchain undergoes multi-stage transformation to extract relevant payment metadata.

**Schema Standardization**  
Heterogeneous data sources are normalized into unified schemas for consistent downstream processing.

**Event Aggregation**  
Micro-transactions are aggregated into logical payment units for efficient settlement reconciliation.

## Transformation Architecture

### Stream Processing Layer

The protocol utilizes event-driven architecture for real-time data transformation. Kafka-style message queues ensure reliable processing of high-volume transaction streams.

### Data Enrichment Pipeline

**Metadata Enhancement**  
Transaction data is enriched with merchant categorization, geographic indicators, and risk scores.
