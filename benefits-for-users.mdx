## Passive Rewards
Token holders are reimbursed through the buyback model, aligning user participation with platform success.

## Card Activity Integration
Every transaction made with Entro cards contributes to the buyback system, meaning that everyday spending fuels demand for $ENTRO and passively benefits all holders.

## Sustainable Growth
As usage of Entro cards expands, the buyback mechanism continuously supports token value and ecosystem health.
