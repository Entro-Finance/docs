<Steps>
  <Step title="Phase 1: Launch">
    At launch, Entro Finance will integrate with an external API provider to issue **non-reloadable cards**, enabling users to immediately access their funds in a spendable format. This creates a simple and compliant entry point for users.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Phase 2: Evolution">
    Over time, we will transition towards **reloadable cards**. Fees generated through our platform will be used to fund this development, ensuring a sustainable pathway toward long-term card functionality.
