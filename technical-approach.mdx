At launch, Entro Finance will integrate with an external API provider to issue **non-reloadable cards**, enabling users to immediately access their funds in a spendable format. This creates a simple and compliant entry point for users.

Over time, we will transition towards **reloadable cards**. Fees generated through our platform will be used to fund this development, ensuring a sustainable pathway toward long-term card functionality.
