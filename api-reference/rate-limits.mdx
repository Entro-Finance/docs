# Rate Limits

API rate limits prevent abuse and ensure fair usage across all users.

## Current Limits

| Plan | Requests/minute | Requests/day | Burst limit |
|------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Free | 100 | 10,000 | 200 |
| Pro | 1,000 | 100,000 | 2,000 |
| Enterprise | 10,000 | 1,000,000 | 20,000 |

## Headers

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```http
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Handling Rate Limits

When you exceed rate limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

}
```
