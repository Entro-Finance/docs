# Authentication

The Entro Finance API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can generate API keys from your dashboard.

## API Key Authentication

Include your API key in the request headers:

```http
GET /api/v1/balances
Host: api.entrofinance.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json
```

## Rate Limits

API requests are limited based on your subscription tier:

| Tier | Requests per minute | Requests per day |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| Free | 100 | 10,000 |
| Pro | 1,000 | 100,000 |
| Enterprise | 10,000 | 1,000,000 |

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
Never expose your API keys in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

- Store API keys securely in environment variables
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use different keys for different environments
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity
