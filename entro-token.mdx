# The $ENTRO Token

To complement the Entro ecosystem, we are introducing **$ENTRO**, a Solana-based token designed to connect card usage with ecosystem participation.

## Purpose of $ENTRO

### Ecosystem Utility
Serves as a native asset tied to the growth and expansion of Entro Finance.

### Holder Rewards
Rewards from the platform 'Pump.fun' from $ENTRO will be cycled back into the token through buybacks.

### Flywheel System
By combining card activity with token incentives, $ENTRO creates a self-reinforcing cycle where users can be rewarded passively from benefits of being a token holder and using our cards.

### Further Funding
Allowing Entro Finance to not only receive funding of future development from fees of the cards, but also increasing our funding through the nature of $ENTRO.
