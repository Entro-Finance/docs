# Introduction

Entro Finance is the bridge between crypto and everyday spending. Built on Solana, we are creating a platform that allows digital assets to be used as seamlessly as traditional money. Our mission is to eliminate unnecessary barriers between holding crypto and actually spending it in daily life.

## The Problem

While crypto continues to grow worldwide, real-world usability remains limited. Many platforms force users through complicated processes, wallet connections, or restrictions that leave funds locked or vulnerable. Traditional payment rails don't integrate smoothly with digital assets, which prevents crypto from achieving its potential as a true medium of exchange.

## Our Solution

Entro Finance simplifies the process of spending crypto:

- Users can instantly access their assets through Entro cards
- Payments work both online and in person with the speed and familiarity of existing payment methods
- Our platform reduces unnecessary steps, making crypto spending effortless
