# Buyback Mechanism

The ENTRO buyback mechanism creates consistent buying pressure and value accrual for token holders through systematic market purchases.

## Revenue Sources

### Primary Revenue Streams

All protocol revenues contribute to the buyback pool:

| Source | Contribution | Monthly Average |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| Card Transaction Fees | 0.5% of volume | $250,000 |
| Merchant Processing | 0.1-0.5% of volume | $150,000 |
| ATM Withdrawals | $2.50 per transaction | $75,000 |
| Premium Subscriptions | $10-50/month | $25,000 |

### Buyback Allocation

**50% of all protocol revenue** is allocated to buybacks

## Execution Strategy

### Automated Buyback System

```javascript
const buybackEngine = {
  frequency: 'WEEKLY',
  minBuyAmount: 10000, // $10,000 USD
  maxSlippage: 0.02, // 2%
  
  async executeBuyback(amount) {
    // Split orders across DEXs
    const orders = [
      { dex: 'Raydium', allocation: 0.4 },
      { dex: 'Orca', allocation: 0.3 },
      { dex: 'Jupiter', allocation: 0.3 }
    ];
    
    for (const order of orders) {
      await this.marketBuy({
        dex: order.dex,
        amount: amount * order.allocation,
        maxSlippage: this.maxSlippage
      });
    }
  }
};
```

### Buyback Schedule

- **Frequency**: Weekly on random days
- **Time**: Random times to prevent front-running
- **Amount**: Based on accumulated revenue
- **Method**: Market buys across multiple DEXs

## Token Allocation

Bought tokens are allocated as follows:

### 70% Burned
- Permanently removed from circulation
- Sent to null address
- Creates deflationary pressure

### 30% Staking Rewards
- Distributed to stakers
- Incentivizes long-term holding
- Compounds staking APY

## Impact Analysis

### Supply Reduction

| Year | Tokens Burned | Supply Remaining | Reduction |
|------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| 1 | 25,000,000 | 975,000,000 | 2.5% |
| 2 | 45,000,000 | 930,000,000 | 7.0% |
| 3 | 60,000,000 | 870,000,000 | 13.0% |
| 5 | 85,000,000 | 785,000,000 | 21.5% |

### Price Impact Model

Buyback creates consistent upward pressure:
- Weekly buying removes sell pressure
- Supply reduction increases scarcity
- Staking rewards reduce circulating supply
