# Buyback Mechanism

The ENTRO buyback mechanism creates consistent buying pressure and value accrual for token holders through systematic market purchases.

## Revenue Architecture

### Protocol Revenue Streams

The buyback mechanism is funded through multiple protocol revenue sources:

**Transaction Processing**  
Fees generated from payment processing and settlement operations

**Network Services**  
Revenue from API access, premium features, and institutional services

**Infrastructure Fees**  
Charges for white-label solutions and enterprise integrations

### Allocation Framework

A portion of protocol revenue is systematically allocated to buyback operations through smart contract automation

## Execution Strategy

### Automated Buyback System

### Execution Framework

Programmatic buyback execution through automated market operations. Smart contract-based execution ensures transparency and verifiability of all buyback transactions.

### Buyback Protocol

- **Execution Timing**: Randomized intervals to prevent gaming
- **Amount Determination**: Algorithmic calculation based on protocol revenue
- **Distribution Method**: Automated market operations through smart contracts

## Token Allocation

Bought tokens are allocated as follows:

### 70% Burned
- Permanently removed from circulation
- Sent to null address
- Creates deflationary pressure

### 30% Staking Rewards
- Distributed to stakers
- Incentivizes long-term holding
- Compounds staking APY

## Impact Analysis

### Supply Dynamics

Systematic token burns create deflationary pressure on total supply. The reduction in circulating tokens compounds over time, creating natural scarcity.

### Market Mechanics

Consistent buyback operations provide structural support for token value through:
- Regular market absorption of selling pressure
- Progressive supply reduction through burns
- Decreased circulation through staking incentives

## Transparency
